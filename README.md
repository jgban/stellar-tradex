# stellar-tradex
Stellar Trade Explorer
This gives information about recent offers the stellar network.
It also allows users to query for bids/asks and recent trades for a given asset pair.

It gets the recent trades by querying the most recent operations and then filtering out the manage offers and create passive offers operations. In doing so, it gives an idea of what offers are currently being made for any asset pair and you can bid accordingly. 

Please do get in touch if there are better ways of doing this. Will be most interested.
To see how it works use the demo page below.
